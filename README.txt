---

== Blocks ==


You can embed the calendar by adding a **OSEC Calendar Block** to any page or post. Alternatively there is a shortcode available.

> [!WARNING] 
> At this time, only **one calendar per page or post** is supported.

On the long run it's planned to have a Rest API to allow the calendar being rendered with more modern frontend tools than the current, outdated, but nice old Bootstrap 3 stuff.

### Shortcodes

#### Calendar Views

    [osec]                       // Default view per settings
    [osec view="monthly"]
    [osec view="weekly"]
    [osec view="agenda"]
    [osec view="daily"]

#### Filtering

**By category**

    [osec cat_name="Holidays"]
    [osec cat_name="Lunar Cycles,zodia-date-ranges"]
    [osec cat_id="1"]
    [osec cat_id="1,2"]

**By tag**

    [osec tag_name="tips-and-tricks"]
    [osec tag_name="creative writing,performing arts"]
    [osec tag_id="1"]
    [osec tag_id="1,2"]

**By post ID**

    [osec post_id="1"]
    [osec post_id="1,2"]

== Requirements ==


- WordPress: 6.6 or newer
- PHP:
  - PHP 8.2+ required for development
  - PHP 8.1 may work for production builds when installed with `composer install --no-dev`

== Installation ==


Install as any other plugin, or from GitHub.

**Setup steps**

1. Open the plugin settings page and save once
2. Configure:
    - Timezone
    - UI date formats
    - Week start day
3. Review `WordPress → Settings → General` for output date formats.

---

== Languages ==


OSEC supports multiple languages

== This Is a Fork ==


OSEC is a fork of the GPL licensed plugin All-in-one-Event-Calendar by Timely. At it's time a great plugin with a solid but unmaintainable codebase (not all required developer tools where opensourced).

If you love truly open source software and don't mind to get your hands dirty you should join here. Free people need free software to manage and share events in a selfhosted manner.

== External services ==


OSEC may connect to OpenStreetMap to render maps. If you using maps feature make sure you agree with [Terms of Service](https://operations.osmfoundation.org/policies/)

OSEC may connect to OpenStreetMap Nominatim geocoding API. [Terms of Service](https://operations.osmfoundation.org/policies/nominatim/).
You may need to switch the servive on a heavy traffic site as Nominatim allows an *absolute maximum of 1 request per second*.

By default leaflet and leaflet-control-geocoder are loaded from unpkg.com. [Terms of Service](https://app.unpkg.com/policies@1.0.1).

You can change using hooks: `osec_leaflet_library_alter`, `osec_leaflet_geocoder_library_alter`.

== Migration Notes ==

Database structure is not fully compatible with All-in-One Event Calendar v2.3.4

Migration may be possible with manual effort

A standardized upgrade path may be developed if there is demand and contributions

See this [wiki](https://github.com/digitaldonkey/open-source-event-calendar/wiki/migration-from-all%E2%80%90in%E2%80%90one%E2%80%90event%E2%80%90calendar) for currently known information on migrating.

== Development & Support ==


The principle behind this plugin is to be Open Source. Get in touch on [GitHub](https://github.com/digitaldonkey/open-source-event-calendar) to report issues, propose feature enhancements, and get general guidance for contributing.

Writing this fork was [a huge effort](https://github.com/wp-plugins/all-in-one-event-calendar/compare/master...digitaldonkey:open-source-event-calendar:master).

Digitaldonkey believes everybody should be able to set up and manage public calendars. 

If you are implementing this plugin for others you should support ongoing development with a [donation](https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=ZNWEQRQNJBTE6) or [contribution](https://github.com/digitaldonkey/open-source-event-calendar/issues).

# events_tags       => osec_events_tags
